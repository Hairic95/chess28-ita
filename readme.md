# Chess28 Core Rules System

## #chess28 Manifesto
We seek to liberate the chess board from a millennium of tedium. Let the richly-painted warriors of a thousand worlds battle across their checkered fields! Let the clatter of dice despoil their cold and logical perfection! Let the chess board be a playground of the imagination!

1. We demand that chess be miniatures-agnostic. If a game prostitutes the chess board to the pageantry of painted figures, let it be #chess28. 
2. We demand that chess submit to the capricious whims of fate. If a game corrupts the use of the chess board by admitting chance, let it be #chess28. 
3. 28mm is a lie. #chess28 cares nothing for scale. If a miniature fits upon a chess square, let it be #chess28.

# Core Rules
Herein lies the Core Rules of [Chess28](https://planetsmashergames.com/chess28) ¬© 2024 by [Mike Hutchinson](https://planetsmashergames.com/) is licensed under [CC BY 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/?ref=chooser-v1).

## Rules Conventions

### Rule of Carnage
In this game, if a rule is unclear, choose whichever option results in the most carnage for all concerned. This is **The Rule Of Carnage**.

#### Game Terms
Throughout these rules, you will see game terms introduced **Like This**. After a new game term has been introduced and defined, it will then appear as plain English from then on, like this, albeit loaded with the special meaning you now understand.

### More Specific Rules
The text of a specific rule can conflict with the general rules. In case of a conflict, the text relating to the more specific circumstance overrides the more general rule.

### Simultaneous Effects
If the effects of multiple rules appear to occur at the same time, the player whose turn it is decides the order of resolution. If this is unclear for any reason, roll-off and the winner of the roll-off decides the order of resolution.

### Roll-Off
Whenever a roll-off is required, both players roll a D6 and the player with the highest result is the winner of the roll-off. In the event of a tie, the players roll-off again.

### Scattering
If the rules ask for you to scatter a model or object, or to determine a random direction: pick a board edge and roll a D8. Consult this chart, with the ‚Äò1-3‚Äô results being the squares closest to the selected board edge.

## Anatomy of a Model
Models have a **Facing**, and a **Character Card** which lists all their stats.

Facing must always be one of North, South, East or West, not diagonal. If the facing of the model is not clear from its pose or base, put a mark on the base to indicate its facing.

### Anatomy of a Character Card
* **Unit Name**
* **Cost**: the cost to include this model in your warband.
* **Move Chart:** shows where the model can move to. The chart is oriented relative to the model‚Äôs current facing, with the solid directional block (‚ñ≤) indicating the model‚Äôs current square.
* **Attack Chart**: shows where the model can attack. The sword icons (üó°Ô∏è) indicate the model‚Äôs Melee Range.
* **Special Abilities**: lists any special abilities the model has, including any Ranged Weapons.
    * For **Ranged Weapons**, the arrows tell you which directions the model can shoot in, plus the attack‚Äôs Range and Strength).
* **Fight value:** used when making Melee Attacks.
* **Health Points (HP):** the number of wounds the model can suffer before it is dead.
* **Defence value:** used when targeted by an attack.


### Squares

A single square may only ever contain a single model, although it may contain both a model and any number of objects or tokens (such as treasure chests or wound tokens).

Each square counts as adjacent to the eight squares that surround it, meaning squares that are connected diagonally _do_ count as adjacent to each other.


#### Backline

Your **Backline** is the row of squares closest to your board edge, also known as the back rank.


## Setting Up To Play



1. You will both need to construct a party, totaling 300 Points worth of models and conforming to the Faction restrictions. See Building a Party.
2. Choose or randomly select a game mode.
3. Draw 3 Gambit Cards.
4. You both roll a dice, re-rolling ties: the player that rolls the highest becomes the First Player.
5. The first player chooses a board edge. The other player takes the opposite board edge.
6. The first player rolls D3-1. You each take that many pieces of terrain, dividing the large and small pieces evenly. Starting with the first player, take turns to place a piece of terrain into play. You may place the terrain pieces anywhere that is outside of the back two ranks of either player‚Äôs board edge.


### Deployment

The first player deploys the first model, and then you alternate deploying one model each. Deploy your models onto your own backline, ensuring that each square contains only one model, and the facing of each model is clear. If your backline is full, you may deploy on the next row in.


## Playing The Game

On your turn, you activate up to three models. Each model may take one action.
* **Move:** The model moves using the movement rules given below.
* **Charge:** The model moves, and then may make a Melee Attack.
* **Melee Attack:** The model makes a Melee Attack, using the Melee Attack rules given below.
* **Ranged Attack:** The model to make a Ranged Attack, using the Ranged Attack rules given below.

Once per turn, in place of activating a model, you may take the follow general action:
* **Refresh:** Move one Drained model back to your Dead Pile. That model may be drained again.
  

## Moving

To move a model:
1. Orient the Move Chart
2. Select a Destination Square
3. Spend AP to move (each square moved requires 1AP)
4. Pivot if permitted or forced


### Check the Move Chart

When you wish to move a model, check its Move chart:

If the chart has a solid directional block (‚ñ≤) at its heart: orient the chart relative to the model‚Äôs current facing, with the solid directional block (‚ñ≤) indicating the model‚Äôs current square and facing.

If the chart has a solid circle (‚óè) as its heart, you may orient the chart as you wish before moving, with the solid circle indicating the model‚Äôs current square.


### Select a Destination Square

Select one of the squares marked with an icon on your Move Chart as your destination square. The destination square must be unoccupied and you must have a valid path to it.

If the destination square has a fast-forward icon (‚è©) in it, the model may keep moving in that direction as many squares as it likes, until its movement is blocked by terrain, another model or the edge of the board. The model does not pivot.


### Trace a Path
* Move from square to adjacent square on a path to the destination square.
* Models may not move through squares occupied by enemy models.
* Models may move through squares occupied by friendly models, but may not end their moves on occupied squares.
* A square counts as ‚Äòadjacent‚Äô to the eight squares that surround it, so you can move diagonally.


### Pivot if permitted or forced
* ‚ñ≥: If the destination square is marked with a hollow directional block (‚ñ≥,‚ñ∑,‚ñΩ,‚óÅ) the model must be pivoted to that facing at the end of their move.
* ‚óØ: If the destination square is marked with a hollow circle (‚óØ), the model may be pivoted to any facing at the end of their move.


## Melee Attacks
When you wish to make a Melee Attack with a model, check its Attack chart. The chart is oriented relative to the model‚Äôs current facing, with the solid directional block (‚ñ≤) indicating the model‚Äôs current square. You can target a single enemy model in the model‚Äôs **Melee Range**, indicated by the squares marked with a sword icon (üó°Ô∏è). Resolve a Combat with the target, as described below.


### Supporting in Melee

**Supporting the Attacker:** When making a Melee Attack, all friendly models that have the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">target model</span> within their Melee Range may support the attacker. Add 1 to the attacker‚Äôs Fight value for each friendly model supporting it.

**Supporting the Defender:** When targeted with a Melee Attack, all friendly models that have the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">attacking model</span> within their Melee Range may support the defender. Add 1 to the defender‚Äôs Defence value for each friendly model supporting it.


## Ranged Attacks
When you wish to make a Ranged Attack with a model, check the description of the Ranged Weapon. It will list one or more directional arrows: (‚ÜñÔ∏è, ‚¨ÜÔ∏è, ‚ÜóÔ∏è), and a Range. The arrows tell you in which directions the model can attack, and the range tells you how far.

A weapon‚Äôs **Range** is the maximum number of squares away a target may be while still being a valid target. You cannot target adjacent squares with Ranged Attacks.


### Making Ranged Attacks
To make a Ranged Attack:
1. Pick a direction
2. Target the first model in that direction within range
3. Resolve a combat with the target

You cannot target friendly models, so if the first model is a friendly model, you must shoot in a different direction, or not at all.

_For example, a Ranged attack that lists Range 3 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è may target enemy models in a direct line forward from this model, up to three squares away from the model (but not in an adjacent square)._

Resolve a Combat with the target, as described below.


## Combat

When a model attacks a target, do this:
1. Attacker rolls to hit (needing 4+)
2. Defender rolls to save (needing 5+)
3. Unsaved hits become wounds
4. Defender is pushed back


### Attacker rolls to hit

The attacker rolls a number of D6 equal to their active stat (Fight for melee attacks, Strength for ranged attacks, other stats may be listed in the action). Each 4+ counts as a hit. Each 6 counts as two hits instead.


### Defender rolls to save
The defender rolls a number of D6 equal to their Defence stat. Each 5+ counts as a save. Each save cancels one incoming hit.


### Unsaved hits become wounds

For each unsaved hit, the defender receives one wound token.

When a model has a number of wound tokens equal to or above its HP stat, it is Dead and removed from play.


### Defender is pushed back

If the defender is still in play, and the attacker rolled any hits (regardless of whether the wounds were cancelled by saves), the defender is pushed back.


## Push Back

When a model is Pushed Back, the opposing player chooses one of the three squares opposite the source of the push back, which must be an empty square: the model moves into that square without changing its facing.

If all the squares are occupied or off the board, the model suffers one wound instead of being pushed back. 

If the source of the Push Back is impossible to determine, scatter the model instead.


### Push Back Examples
A is the source of the push back (e.g. an melee attacker). The target must be pushed back into one of the three squares marked ‚ÄòC‚Äô.

## Dead Pile

When a model has suffered a number of wounds equal to or above its HP stat: it is Dead and is removed from play. Place it off the board, in the **Dead Pile**.


### Draining Dead Models

Models in your Dead Pile may be Drained for additional effects. When a dead model is Drained, move it to a separate **Drained Pile**, or lay it on its side, to indicate it has been drained. Once drained, a model may not be drained again. You need to drain models to use Gambit cards, and for the Heroic Fortune Re-roll rule.

**Heroic Fortune Re-roll:** After rolling your dice in a combat, either attack dice or defence dice, you may Drain a single model in your Dead Pile to re-roll your dice. You must re-roll all the dice. You cannot re-roll the dice more than once in a single combat.


## Gambit Cards
Before the start of the game, shuffle the Gambit Cards and deal 3 to each player, face down.

To play a Gambit Card you must first Drain a dead model. 

Once played, the card is removed from the game.


### Gambit Card Text

These are the Gambit Cards:
1. [ACE OF CLUBS] **Vault: **Play during your turn. Select a friendly model, for its next Move or Charge action treat every square on its Move Chart as containing a hollow circle.
2. **Dash:** Play during your turn. Select a friendly model, as its next Move or Charge action it may move any number of squares in any one direction.
3. **Castle:** Play during your turn. Swap the positions of two friendly models (without changing their facings)
4. **Warp Reality:** Play during your turn. For the rest of this turn, the left and right board edges count as adjacent
5. **Awe:** Play during your turn. Choose a friendly model. Push Back every adjacent model, in an order of your choosing.
6. **Haste:** Play during your turn. Choose a friendly model. It may be activated more than once this turn.
7. **Moment of Glory**: Play during your turn. Play at the start of a combat, all your attack dice hit, you do not need to roll.
8. **Relentless:** Play during any turn. Play when a model of yours would receive wounds, cancel all incoming wounds.
9. **Fall Back!:** Play during your turn. For the rest of the turn, friendly models may take the Retreat action. If they do, place them anywhere on your backline.
10. **Last Gasp:** Play when a friendly model would be removed from play as dead: that model immediately makes a melee attack before it is removed.
11. JACK: **Iron Skin:** Play during any turn. Choose a friendly model. For the rest of the game until it suffers a wound, it saves hits on a 2+.
12. QUEEN: **Fortify:** Play during your turn. Bring on 3HP worth of dead or drained models as reinforcements
13. KING: **Mystic Bolt:** Play during your turn. Choose a friendly model, it makes a free Ranged Attack (‚ÜñÔ∏è, ‚¨ÜÔ∏è, ‚ÜóÔ∏è) Range 10, Strength 4.
14. [ACE OF SPADES]: **Carpe Diem**: Play during your turn. Activate three additional models. Each model may still only be activated once.
15. [ACE OF DIAMONDS] **Sacrifice**: Play during your turn. Select a friendly model on the enemy backline. Swap that model with any model from your Dead or Drained Pile.
16. [ACE OF HEARTS] **Desiccate**: Play during any turn. Move all your Drained models back to your Dead Pile. They may be drained again.

_[I may need to pick the best 12 of these.]_

Note: The Gambit cards are listed with playing card values, so that you can use standard playing cards in place of the print and play cards.


## Desperation

The first time in each game that more than half of your starting models are Dead or Drained, you may draw two Gambit Cards._ [I‚Äôll probably cut this rule, I always forget it during playtesting]._


## Terrain
Terrain can be **Blocking**, **Perilous** and/or **Moveable**. They may occupy a single square, or multiple squares.

**Blocking**: blocks movement and ranged attacks. Models may not move into or through this square. When making ranged attacks, this terrain piece counts as a model for the purposes of finding the first model in a given direction. (E.g. a stone pillar).

**Perilous**: models that move into this square immediately suffer 1 wound. (E.g. a pit trap, a bonfire).

**Moveable**: a model in the same square as this terrain piece, or an adjacent square, may use its activation to the **Shove** action to move the terrain piece into any adjacent square..


## Reinforcements

When a model is placed into play as a **Reinforcement**, it is placed onto an empty square on your backline.


## Common Special Abilities

**Leap**: This model may ignore models and terrain when moving, but must still select an unoccupied square as its destination. (6pts)

**Incorporeal:** This model may ignore models and terrain when moving, and may be ignored by enemy models when they move. Models must still select an unoccupied square as their destination. (4pts)

**Barge**: After pushing back a target in melee, this model may move into the target‚Äôs previously occupied square. (5pts)

**Stubborn**: Only Pushed Back in melee if the attacker rolls two or more hits. (5pts)

**Chill Grasp**: Attacks that roll a 6 cannot be saved. (10pts)

**Dig**: Action to leave play. Set the model aside. On a subsequent turn, action to place the model on any edge square, but not in the enemy‚Äôs back rank. (10pts)

**Fancy Footwork:** After pushing back a target in melee, this model may make a free Move action. (10pts)

**Bloodlust**: Once per turn, after killing an enemy model, this model may make a free Melee Attack action. (5pts)



## Optional Rules: Building a custom model

The Factions section of this rulebook _[WILL]_ detail the models that I have designed for this game. You should use those models, as they _[WILL]_ have been balanced against each other through playtesting. If you are interested in creating your own models for the game, or wish to use my Chess28 core rules system as a basis for your own game, you might be interested in a system for creating the stats and costs of new models.

Use this system at your own risk, it will not produce ‚Äòwell-balanced‚Äô models at the press of a button, you will need to playtest the outputs to see if they feel right to you and your opponent.


### Creating a custom model
* Name the model.
* Move Chart:
    * Place hollow directional arrows (at a cost of 1pt per square) and/or hollow circles (at a cost of 2pts per square) wherever you like.
    * If you change the solid directional arrow at the heart of the movement chart for a solid circle, you must 4x the total cost of the movement chart.
* Attack Chart:
    * Each sword icon you place in an adjacent square costs 1pt.
    * Each sword icon you place in a non-adjacent square costs 2pts.
* Missile Weapons:
    * Each directional arrow you add to the missile weapon costs a number of points depending on the strength of the weapon:
        * Strength 2 = 2pts / arrow
        * Strength 3 = 4pts / arrow
        * Strength 4 = 7pts / arrow
        * Strength 5 = 12pts / arrow
* Fight & Defence values. Give the model Fight & Defence values, at these costs:
    * 0 = -1pts
    * 1 = 0pts
    * 2 = 3pt
    * 3 = 5pts
    * 4 = 8pts
    * 5 = 12pts
    * 6 = 16pts
    * 7 = 20pts
* HP value. Give the model an HP value, at this cost:
    * 1 = 5pts
    * 2 = 10pt
    * 3 = 18pts
    * 4 = 25pts
    * 5 = 32pts
* Special Abilities: Pick them and pay the points.

## TODO: Example Faction: The Cursed Court

## Example Game Mode: Pi√±ata

Each player begins the game with a single Treasure Chest, which is placed on one of the central two squares of their back-line. The Treasure Chest is a piece of Moveable terrain.

A Treasure chest may be targeted with attacks, but not if there is an enemy model in the same square as it. The Treasure chests have Defence 4 and 3 HP. Treasure chests cannot be pushed back.

The first player to destroy the enemy Treasure Chest is the winner.
 

## Quick Reference

### The Turn

On your turn, you activate up to three models. Each model may take one action.
* **Move:** The model moves using the movement rules given below.
* **Charge:** The model moves, and then may make a Melee Attack.
* **Melee Attack:** The model makes a Melee Attack, using the Melee Attack rules given below.
* **Ranged Attack:** The model to make a Ranged Attack, using the Ranged Attack rules given below.

Once per turn, in place of activating a model, you may take the follow general action:
* **Refresh:** Move one Drained model back to your Dead Pile. That model may be drained again.


### Combat

1. Attacker rolls Fight x D6 (4+ to hit, 6 is two hits)
2. Defender rolls Def x D6 (5+ to save)
3. Unsaved hits become wounds
4. If any hits were rolled, defender is pushed back (regardless if saved)

**Heroic Re-roll**: Drain a dead model to re-roll all your attack or defence dice.
